One of the most addictive game is 2048 which is available across all platforms even in wearable devices. we forked a clone from the original game 2048 by Gabriele Cirulli due to time constraint and created an agent which capable of playing the game without human interference and with an increased possibility of winning this game when compared to an average player. For this, we used exceptiminimax often referred as expectimax to solve the game which calculates all the possible moves and selects the one with highest probability.
